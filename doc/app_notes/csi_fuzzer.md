[Openwifi CSI fuzzer for authorized sensing and covert channels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07428.pdf) (accepted by ACM WiSec 2021)

CSI (Channel State Information) of WiFi systems is available in some WiFi chips and can be used for sensing the environment (keystrokes, people, object) passively and secretly.
 
How could a CSI fuzzer stop unauthorized sensing?

Thanks to the full-duplex capability and CSI extraction feature of openwifi, you can monitor the artificial channel response via [side channel](./csi.md) by Tx-Rx over the air coupling without affecting the normal operation/traffic of openwifi. Before the self-monitoring, the auto-mute during Tx needs to be disabled:

```
./sdrctl dev sdr0 set reg xpu 1 1
```

CSI self-monitoring after  fuzzing command: `csi_fuzzer.sh 1 45 0 13`

`csi_fuzzer_scan.sh` can scan the c1 and c2 in different styles/modes by calling `csi_fuzzer.sh`.
